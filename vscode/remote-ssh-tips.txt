Preference .json, add:

 "remote.SSH.serverInstallPath": {
    "whackathon": "/home/username/.vscode-server.marcverd"
  },

This way, each real person can run remote-ssh-ed vscode concurrently without
stepping into each other's configs.

By default, remote-ssh uses $HOME/.vscode-server, so we want each individual
to use $PREFIX/.vscode-server (NOTE: vscode automatically create the
leaf dir .vscode-server).
