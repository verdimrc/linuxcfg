#     ln -s ~/src/linuxcfg/.local/bin/jq ~/bin/
# because Ubuntu 22.04 puts ~/.local/bin after /usr/**/bin, and my .zshrc
# prepend ~/bin before those /usr/**/bin.

# NOTE: wrapper is meant to be used in a pipe.
# - jq => calls /usr/bin/jq, print usage.
# - USE_ROBUST_JQ=1 jq => hangs, waiting on stdin
